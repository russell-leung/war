# Problem Statement
-----------------
War is a game in which two players utalize a deck of 52 cards, the deck is randomly suffled and put into 
two seperate decks of 26, one for each user. With he highet card being the ace and the lowest card being the 2,
the uses simotaniously flip the first card in their decks and the player with the highest value card takes
both player's cards. If the users both flip a card of the same value then a "war" will start. Both users will
place 3 cards face dow and flip their 4th card, the player with the highest value card will take all the cards.
If the users again place down the same value card, another war will start. The game continues until one player
has 0 cards left in their deck.
